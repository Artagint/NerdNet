      <h2>Explore our Courses</h2>
      <p>
        The content that we display on NerdNet consists of a series of Computer
        Science courses: CSE224 (Basic C & Bash), CSE222 (Data Structures &
        Algorithms), and CSE223 (Data Structures & OOP in Java). Alongside,
        there is Computer Engineering courses, ENGR270 (Assembly and
        Microprocessors).
      </p>
      <h2>Empowering Future Programmers</h2>
      <p>
        Our goal is for anyone, regardless of their experience in programming,
        to learn programming in C and Java at an advanced level. Additionally,
        we aim to provide knowledge about bash, digital logic, such as binary
        systems and state machines, as well as assembly. We also cover discrete
        structures, often referred to as discrete math. Learning these topics
        will help strengthen your programming skills and broaden your
        perspective from low-level code to more advanced languages and their
        interaction with machines.
      </p>
      <h2>Where It All Began</h2>
      <p>
        We ourselves have taken these full courses and acquired all of our
        programming skills from them. These courses are video lectures provided
        by Nicholas Macias, Ph.D., and are also available on his YouTube
        channel,

        for free online, allowing everyone to enjoy and learn from them.

      <h2>Why We Started</h2>
      <p>
        NerdNet is made up of a one-man team. We started this website as a
        college assignment that encouraged us to step out of our comfort zone
        beyond what we learn in class, to go out on our own and create our own
        project, called a Service Learning Project (SLP). This project aimed to
        encourage us to learn new aspects of programming and create something
        new and unique to us. We decided to create a website that streams
        educational videos on Computer Science and Engineering. We began with no
        prior knowledge of how to build a website. Starting a project like this
        required us to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Firebase, and API
        integration and understand how these elements tie in together to create
        NerdNet.
