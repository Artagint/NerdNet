        In this course you will learn Intro to C (CSE224), Data Structures and
        Algorithms (CSE222), Advanced Data Structures & OOP (CSE223), and
        Computer Architecture (ENGR270). Doing all parts of the course will give
        you a solid understanding of low and higher-level programming as well as
        how code interacts with the computer. To help you advance through the
        courses each course has videos that cover all the topics necessary. Up
        above on the navigation bar are libraries for C, Java, and Assembly
        (ASM) which should help you through your programming journey. All videos
        were provided by

        become a better programmer and growing a love for the language of
        computers!

            <p>
              In this course you will learn slightly more about C as well as
              some shell programming (bash). The topics covered in C will
              include print 'Hello World', fgets and sscanf, pointers, scripts,
              piping, vi, how to write pseudocode, functions, file I/O, arrays,
              makefiles, and gdb. In bash we will go over making a simple GUI.
              At the end of this course, you will be prepared to then learn the
              next big thing in programming, Data Structures and Alogrithms.

            <p>
              This course covers the fundamentals of data structures and
              advanced programming techniques in C. Topics include structures,
              complexity, pointers, ADTs, memory maps, arrays, linked lists,
              stacks, queues, hash tables, recursion, BSTs, dynamic programming,
              sorting and searching algorithms, graphs, AVL trees, and tries. By
              the end, you'll have a solid understanding of key data structures
              and algorithms.

            <p>
              In this course we will switch off of C and transition into Java to
              learn about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). A solid grasp of
              data structures is required to understand and progress through
              this course. This course will go over basic Java syntax, objects
              and classes, exceptions, data structures (linked lists, trees,
              arrays, hashmaps), generics, GUI's and event-driven code,
              graphics, threading, and server sockets. Finishing this course
              will give you a solid understadning of OOP.

          <div class="courseBack">
            <p>
              This course covers Computer Architecture and how Assembly
              interacts with microprocessors, focusing on the PIC18F1220. Topics
              include bit manipulation, stacks, queues, memory, branches,
              timers, A/D conversion, addressing, C to ASM compilation, and
              networking. By the end, you'll understand low-level programming.
